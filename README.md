# Neutral Mobs

Makes aggressives mobs like Zombies, Skeletons or Creepers become neutral. They will only attack and chase you when you attack them.

## GameRule

```/gamerule neutralMobs true|false``` enables or disables this feature in the world if required.

## F.A.Q.

### Why does this even exist ? Isn't Minecraft easy ?

My girlfriend wanted to play with mobs, but didn't want to get attacked all the times.
